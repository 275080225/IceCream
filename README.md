## Prerequisite
1. Be sure to have enrolled in Apple Developer Program

2. Turn on your iCloud in Capabilities and choose `CloudKit`

3. Turn on Background Modes and check `Background fetch` and `Remote notification` 

## Usage

### Basics
1. Prepare your Realm Object
```swift
class Dog: Object {
    @objc dynamic var id = NSUUID().uuidString
    @objc dynamic var name = ""
    @objc dynamic var age = 0
    @objc dynamic var isDeleted = false

    override class func primaryKey() -> String? {
        return "id"
    }
}
```

2. Make your Realm Object conform to CKRecordConvertible and CKRecordRecoverable 
```swift
extension Dog: CKRecordConvertible {
    /// recordName : this is the unique identifier for the record, used to locate records on the database. We can create our own ID or leave it to CloudKit to generate a random UUID.
    /// For more: https://medium.com/@guilhermerambo/synchronizing-data-with-cloudkit-94c6246a3fda
    var recordID: CKRecordID {
        return CKRecordID(recordName: id, zoneID: Constants.customZoneID)
    }
    
    var record: CKRecord {
        // Simultaneously init CKRecord with zoneID and recordID, thanks to this guy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45429133/how-to-initialize-ckrecord-with-both-zoneid-and-recordid
        let r = CKRecord(recordType: Dog.recordType, recordID: recordID)
        r[.id] = id as CKRecordValue
        r[.age] = age as CKRecordValue
        r[.name] = name as CKRecordValue
        r[.isDeleted] = isDeleted as CKRecordValue
        return r
    }
    
    static var customZoneID: CKRecordZoneID {
        return CKRecordZoneID(zoneName: "DogsZone", ownerName: CKCurrentUserDefaultName)
    }

    static var recordType: String {
        return "Dog"
    }
}

extension Dog: CKRecordRecoverable {
    static func objectFrom(record: CKRecord) -> Object? {
        guard let id = record[.id] as? String,
            let age = record[.age] as? Int,
            let name = record[.name] as? String,
            let isDeleted = record[.isDeleted] as? Bool
            else { return nil }
        
        let dog = Dog()
        dog.id = id
        dog.age = age
        dog.name = name
        
        return dog
    }
}
```

3. Start the Engine!
```swift
var syncEngine: SyncEngine<Dog>?
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    syncEngine = SyncEngine<Dog>()
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    ...
}
```

That's all you need to do! Everytime you write to Realm, the SyncEngine will get notified and handle sync stuffs!

For more details, clone the project to see the source code.

### About Object Deletions

Yep, we highly recommend you use **Soft Deletions**. That's why we add a `isDeleted` property to CKRecordConvertible protocol. 

When you want to delete a object, you just need to set its isDeleted property to true. And the rest of things are already taken care of.

*You also don't need to worry about the clean-up things. It has also been considered.*

Example project is provided to see the detailed usage.

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Swift 4
- Realm Swift ~> 3.0

## Debug Suggestions

It's true that debugging CloudKit is hard and tedious. But I have some tips for you guys when facing puzzles.

- You should know how Realm and CloudKit works. 
- Using GUI tools, like [Realm Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/realm-browser/id1007457278?mt=12) and [CloudKit Dashboard](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard).
- When you are lost and don't remember where you are, I suggest starting all over again. In CloudKit Dashboard, "Reset..." button is provided. You can also
clear local database by re-install apps.
- Keep calm and carry on!

*Warning: If you're going to launch your app onto App Store, don't forget to deploy your environment settings to production. You can do it easily in the CloudKit Dashboard. Write & Read permissions are also need to be considered.*

### One More Tip
How to debug CloudKit in production mode? See this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30182521/use-production-cloudkit-during-development).

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

IceCream is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'IceCream'
```
