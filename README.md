IceCream helps you sync Realm Database with CloudKit.

## Features

- Realm Database
    - [x] Off-line First
    - [x] Reactive Programming

- Apple CloudKit
    - [x] Automatical Authentication
    - [x] Data Deletion
    - [x] Reachability(Support Long-lived Operation) 
    - [x] Error Handling
- [] Complete Documentation 

## Prerequisite
1. Be sure to enroll in Apple Developer Program

2. Navigate to project settings

3. Turn on your iCloud in Capabilities and choose `CloudKit`

4. Turn on Background Modes and check `Background fetch` and `Remote notification` 

## Usage
1. Prepare your Realm Object
```swift
class Dog: Object {
    @objc dynamic var id = NSUUID().uuidString
    @objc dynamic var name = ""
    @objc dynamic var age = 0
    
    override class func primaryKey() -> String? {
        return "id"
    }
}
```

2. Make your Realm Object conform to CKRecordConvertible and CKRecordRecoverable 
```swift
extension Dog: CKRecordConvertible {
    /// recordName : this is the unique identifier for the record, used to locate records on the database. We can create our own ID or leave it to CloudKit to generate a random UUID.
    /// For more: https://medium.com/@guilhermerambo/synchronizing-data-with-cloudkit-94c6246a3fda
    var recordID: CKRecordID {
        return CKRecordID(recordName: id, zoneID: Constants.customZoneID)
    }
    
    var record: CKRecord {
        // Simultaneously init CKRecord with zoneID and recordID, thanks to this guy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45429133/how-to-initialize-ckrecord-with-both-zoneid-and-recordid
        let r = CKRecord(recordType: Dog.recordType, recordID: recordID)
        r[.id] = id as CKRecordValue
        r[.age] = age as CKRecordValue
        r[.name] = name as CKRecordValue
        return r
    }
    
    static var recordType: String {
        return "Dog"
    }
}

extension Dog: CKRecordRecoverable {
    static func objectFrom(record: CKRecord) -> Object? {
        guard let id = record[.id] as? String,
            let age = record[.age] as? Int,
            let name = record[.name] as? String
            else { return nil }
        
        let dog = Dog()
        dog.id = id
        dog.age = age
        dog.name = name
        
        return dog
    }
}
```

3. Start the Engine!
```swift
var syncEngine: SyncEngine<Dog>?
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    syncEngine = SyncEngine<Dog>()
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    ...
}
```
